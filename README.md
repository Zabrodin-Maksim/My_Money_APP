## Description

The "My Money" program is designed to track personal finances and manage the user's budget. Here is a brief description of the main functions of the program:
*	**Expense tracking:** Users can record their expenses, specifying the type of expense (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment, etc.) and the amount of money spent.

*	**Custom expense types:** Users can create their own expense categories to more accurately track their expenses. For example, they can add categories such as "sports," "travel," "gifts," etc.

*	**Budget planning:** Users can set limits on each type of expense, determining how much they plan to spend on a specific category each month.

*	**Saving money:** Users can set aside money into a separate account (e.g., savings account or investments). In the program, they can specify these actions to achieve their financial goals. The saved money can be used to purchase large items, travel, or other purposes.

*	**Setting financial goals:** Users can set specific savings goals, defining the desired amount. The program will help track the user's progress.
Thus, the "My Money" program provides users with tools for more effective management of their finances, expense planning, and achieving financial goals.
