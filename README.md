## Description

The "My Money" program is designed to track personal finances and manage the user's budget. Here is a brief description of the main functions of the program:
*	**Expense tracking:** Users can record their expenses, specifying the type of expense (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment, etc.) and the amount of money spent.

*	**Custom expense types:** Users can create their own expense categories to more accurately track their expenses. For example, they can add categories such as "sports," "travel," "gifts," etc.

*	**Budget planning:** Users can set limits on each type of expense, determining how much they plan to spend on a specific category each month.

*	**Saving money:** Users can set aside money into a separate account (e.g., savings account or investments). In the program, they can specify these actions to achieve their financial goals. The saved money can be used to purchase large items, travel, or other purposes.

*	**Setting financial goals:** Users can set specific savings goals, defining the desired amount. The program will help track the user's progress.
Thus, the "My Money" program provides users with tools for more effective management of their finances, expense planning, and achieving financial goals.

The main menu of the program (Dashboard) is designed to display essential information.

The Dashboard window features a control area, namely: a sorting period selection slider (day, month, year), which will display expenses according to the day/month/year of the date selected in the calendar below the slider. The "Add" button is intended to navigate to the tab for adding a new expense amount/balance/savings.

The "ADD" tab is intended for adding expenses / replenishing the balance / replenishing savings.

When selecting a record (by default, an expense), unnecessary fields for filling will be removed in "In balance" / "In savings".

The "Plan" tab allows you to edit, add, and delete expense types.

When deleting a type, all existing expenses with the specified deleted type are transferred to the "Other" type, and the program notifies about this.

When attempting to delete the "Other" type, the program warns the user about the impossibility of this operation, as it may disrupt the program's logic.

The "Moneybox" tab allows you to create, edit, and delete savings goals. When a goal is achieved (100% completion) and subsequently removed as completed, the money is automatically withdrawn from the Savings account.

The "History" tab allows sorting (by date or cost) and deleting expense records, with the amount of the deleted record returned to the Balance.
